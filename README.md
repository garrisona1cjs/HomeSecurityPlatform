# HomeSecurityPlatform

## Status: Superseded

This project represents the original prototype and core research platform
for a home network security system.

Development has moved to **HomeSecurity Program**, which builds on the
concepts and logic from this platform and adds:

- Local API layer
- Desktop GUI

- Licensing and installer support

This repository is retained for reference and portfolio purposes.
